Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great Purchase!",18/01/2024,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. Apparently it is very popular. It looks amazing on, fits well and is very handsome. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, definitely not a jacket but nice for cooler evenings. Would definitely. It again."
Brenda,5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars
Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves.

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great Purchase!",18/01/2024,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. Apparently it is very popular. It looks amazing on, fits well and is very handsome. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, definitely not a jacket but nice for cooler evenings. Would definitely. It again."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area.

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product.

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product.

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.

He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!!

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed).

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.

The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.

I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great Purchase!",18/01/2024,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. Apparently it is very popular. It looks amazing on, fits well and is very handsome. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, definitely not a jacket but nice for cooler evenings. Would definitely. It again."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.

My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great Purchase!",18/01/2024,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. Apparently it is very popular. It looks amazing on, fits well and is very handsome. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, definitely not a jacket but nice for cooler evenings. Would definitely. It again."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you.

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed).

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product.

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed).

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.

The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.

The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great Purchase!",18/01/2024,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. Apparently it is very popular. It looks amazing on, fits well and is very handsome. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, definitely not a jacket but nice for cooler evenings. Would definitely. It again."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.

My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.

The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great Purchase!",18/01/2024,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. Apparently it is very popular. It looks amazing on, fits well and is very handsome. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, definitely not a jacket but nice for cooler evenings. Would definitely. It again."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you.

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product.

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed).

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great Purchase!",18/01/2024,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. Apparently it is very popular. It looks amazing on, fits well and is very handsome. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, definitely not a jacket but nice for cooler evenings. Would definitely. It again."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves.

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great Purchase!",18/01/2024,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. Apparently it is very popular. It looks amazing on, fits well and is very handsome. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, definitely not a jacket but nice for cooler evenings. Would definitely. It again."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area.

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product.

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product.

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.

He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!!

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed).

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.

The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.

I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great Purchase!",18/01/2024,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. Apparently it is very popular. It looks amazing on, fits well and is very handsome. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, definitely not a jacket but nice for cooler evenings. Would definitely. It again."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.

My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great Purchase!",18/01/2024,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. Apparently it is very popular. It looks amazing on, fits well and is very handsome. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, definitely not a jacket but nice for cooler evenings. Would definitely. It again."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you.

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed).

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product.

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed).

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.

The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.

The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great Purchase!",18/01/2024,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. Apparently it is very popular. It looks amazing on, fits well and is very handsome. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, definitely not a jacket but nice for cooler evenings. Would definitely. It again."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.

My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.

The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great Purchase!",18/01/2024,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. Apparently it is very popular. It looks amazing on, fits well and is very handsome. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, definitely not a jacket but nice for cooler evenings. Would definitely. It again."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you.

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product.

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed).

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great Purchase!",18/01/2024,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. Apparently it is very popular. It looks amazing on, fits well and is very handsome. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, definitely not a jacket but nice for cooler evenings. Would definitely. It again."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves.

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great Purchase!",18/01/2024,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. Apparently it is very popular. It looks amazing on, fits well and is very handsome. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, definitely not a jacket but nice for cooler evenings. Would definitely. It again."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area.

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product.

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product.

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.

He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!!

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed).

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.

The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.

I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great Purchase!",18/01/2024,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. Apparently it is very popular. It looks amazing on, fits well and is very handsome. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, definitely not a jacket but nice for cooler evenings. Would definitely. It again."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.

My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great Purchase!",18/01/2024,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. Apparently it is very popular. It looks amazing on, fits well and is very handsome. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, definitely not a jacket but nice for cooler evenings. Would definitely. It again."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you.

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed).

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product.

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed).

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.

The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.

The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great Purchase!",18/01/2024,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. Apparently it is very popular. It looks amazing on, fits well and is very handsome. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, definitely not a jacket but nice for cooler evenings. Would definitely. It again."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.

My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.

The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great Purchase!",18/01/2024,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. Apparently it is very popular. It looks amazing on, fits well and is very handsome. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, definitely not a jacket but nice for cooler evenings. Would definitely. It again."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you.

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product.

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed).

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great Purchase!",18/01/2024,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. Apparently it is very popular. It looks amazing on, fits well and is very handsome. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, definitely not a jacket but nice for cooler evenings. Would definitely. It again."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves.

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great Purchase!",18/01/2024,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. Apparently it is very popular. It looks amazing on, fits well and is very handsome. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, definitely not a jacket but nice for cooler evenings. Would definitely. It again."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area.

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product.

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product.

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.

He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!!

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed).

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.

The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.

I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great Purchase!",18/01/2024,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. Apparently it is very popular. It looks amazing on, fits well and is very handsome. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, definitely not a jacket but nice for cooler evenings. Would definitely. It again."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.

My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great Purchase!",18/01/2024,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. Apparently it is very popular. It looks amazing on, fits well and is very handsome. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, definitely not a jacket but nice for cooler evenings. Would definitely. It again."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you.

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed).

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product.

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed).

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.

The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.

The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great Purchase!",18/01/2024,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. Apparently it is very popular. It looks amazing on, fits well and is very handsome. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, definitely not a jacket but nice for cooler evenings. Would definitely. It again."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.

My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.

The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great Purchase!",18/01/2024,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. Apparently it is very popular. It looks amazing on, fits well and is very handsome. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, definitely not a jacket but nice for cooler evenings. Would definitely. It again."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you.

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product.

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed).

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great Purchase!",18/01/2024,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. Apparently it is very popular. It looks amazing on, fits well and is very handsome. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, definitely not a jacket but nice for cooler evenings. Would definitely. It again."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves.

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great Purchase!",18/01/2024,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. Apparently it is very popular. It looks amazing on, fits well and is very handsome. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, definitely not a jacket but nice for cooler evenings. Would definitely. It again."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area.

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product.

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product.

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.

He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!!

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed).

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.

The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.

I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great Purchase!",18/01/2024,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. Apparently it is very popular. It looks amazing on, fits well and is very handsome. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, definitely not a jacket but nice for cooler evenings. Would definitely. It again."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.

My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great Purchase!",18/01/2024,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. Apparently it is very popular. It looks amazing on, fits well and is very handsome. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, definitely not a jacket but nice for cooler evenings. Would definitely. It again."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you.

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed).

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product.

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed).

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.

The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.

The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great Purchase!",18/01/2024,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. Apparently it is very popular. It looks amazing on, fits well and is very handsome. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, definitely not a jacket but nice for cooler evenings. Would definitely. It again."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.

My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.

The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great Purchase!",18/01/2024,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. Apparently it is very popular. It looks amazing on, fits well and is very handsome. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, definitely not a jacket but nice for cooler evenings. Would definitely. It again."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you.

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product.

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

Love!!",02/02/2024,"My husband first received one of these jackets as a gift, he wore and loved it so much I bought him another one in a different color for Christmas. He wears it all day at work and it keeps him at a comfortable temp. Not to hot or bulky. I would say it’s for mid grade weather. Not snow. It’s like a thick heavy tshirt jacket. Super nice quality!! Washes well."

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed).

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Great Purchase!",18/01/2024,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. Apparently it is very popular. It looks amazing on, fits well and is very handsome. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, definitely not a jacket but nice for cooler evenings. Would definitely. It again."

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

Great fabrics and sewing, but terrible snaps, too bad",19/01/2024,"Great fabric and lining, this ""Shaket"" is made of materials that make it Rugged as advertised.Unfortunately, the small snaps used instead of buttons are so weak that even moving my arms while wearing the shirt causes 2 or 3 of them to pop open.  You can see in the pictures that the center of the snap barely enters the outer part, and the result is almost no force holding it closed.If this had buttons I would buy 3 more, but a shirt that won't stay closed in winter weather is going back."

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper."

The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.

Great quality and good fit",15/01/2024,Got this for my husband not knowing if it was going to fit well. It's hard to find something that can fit him well specially around the shoulders and arms. He loves it and it fits him great. Really comfy and warm.

New favorite piece",08/02/2024,"Was looking for a ""sh-acket"" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3"" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed).

Quality. But, the sizes aren't American.",18/12/2023,"I am a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 4XL based on their diagram/chart. Perfect fit, great coat, and light enough that I can wear it in the fall/spring and not just winter. Great value and quality for the price."

Durable, Attractive, Multi-Functional Shirt/Jacket",01/08/2022,"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion"

Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",02/10/2018,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.

My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.
