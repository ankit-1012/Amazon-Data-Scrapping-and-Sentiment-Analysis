# Amazon Reviews Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze customer reviews scraped from Amazon using Beautiful Soup and Requests. The goal is to predict the ratings out of 5 based on the content of the reviews using logistic regression and Naive Bayes multiclass classification algorithms.

## Description
This project involves the following steps:
1. Scraping Amazon reviews: Utilizing Beautiful Soup and Requests libraries in Python, 300 reviews were scraped from Amazon for analysis.
2. Data preprocessing: The scraped reviews were cleaned and processed to remove any unnecessary information and prepare them for analysis.
3. Creating a CSV file: The cleaned reviews were then stored in a CSV file for further analysis and modeling.
4. Modeling: Two machine learning algorithms, logistic regression, and Naive Bayes multiclass classification, were applied to predict the ratings out of 5 based on the review content.
5. Evaluation: The performance of each model was evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess their accuracy and effectiveness.
